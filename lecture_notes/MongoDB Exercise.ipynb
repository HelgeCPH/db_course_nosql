    "# Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement a small database application, which imports a dataset of Twitter tweets from the CSV file into database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your application has to be able to answer queries corresponding to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How many Twitter users are in our database?\n",
    "  * Which Twitter users link the most to other Twitter users? (Provide the top ten.)\n",
    "  * Who is are the most mentioned Twitter users? (Provide the top five.)\n",
    "  * Who are the most active Twitter users (top ten)?\n",
    "  * Who are the five most grumpy (most negative tweets) and the most happy (most positive tweets)? (Provide five users for each group)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Your application can be written in the language of your choice. It must have a form of UI but it is not important if it is a CLI UI, a GUI, or a Web-based UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You present your system's answers to the questions above in a Markdown file on your Github account. That is, you hand in this assignment via Github, with one hand-in per group.\n",
    "Push your solution, source, code, and presentation of the results to a Github repository per group and push a link to your solution in the Moodle hand-in area.\n",
    "The hand-in time is latest 1. May 2017 at 24o'clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download and uncompress a dataset of Twitter tweets from http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In your VM the `unzip` package is not installed by default. Install it via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt-get install unzip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can uncompress the Twitter dataset to your current directory with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "unzip trainingandtestdata.zip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After uncompression you will have a folder with two files. For your exercise you will use the bigger on `training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv`. However, both files are CSV files, which do not contain a header row. The documentation on http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/ says that the columns contain the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data is a CSV with emoticons removed. Data file format has 6 fields:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 0 - the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 1 - the id of the tweet (2087)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 2 - the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 3 - the query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 4 - the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 5 - the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make use of the `--headerline` switch when importing the data with `mongoimport`, we add a headerline accordingly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sed -i '1s;^;polarity,id,date,query,user,text\\n;' training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That leads to that the fields of our documents are named according to the given headerfields.\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing the dataset, the `dates` are represented as strings instead of proper date objects. You might want to convert them with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "db.tweets.find().forEach(function(doc){\n",
    "    if (doc.date instanceof Date !== true) {\n",
    "        doc.date = new Date(doc.date);\n",
    "        db.tweets.save(doc);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For some of the questions, you might want to have a look into MongoDB's aggregation framework and queries using regular expressions. For example, the following query finds all tweets mentioning another Twitter user. \n",
    "\n",
    "```mongo\n",
    "db.tweets.aggregate(\n",
    "    {$match:{text:/@\\w+\\/}},\n",
    "    {$group:{_id:null,text:{$push:\"$text\"}}\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  }
